## About Me

This page shows information about me. It mentions some professional experince and some personal interests of mine. It also has a photo of me dressed professionally.

## Example Page

The example page shows some react skills. It, at the click of a button, will fetch() data from an online API that has data on pokemon. It selects selects 6 random pokemon every time it's clicked. The pokemon data is stored as React-State data so the card component rendered 6 times will update. Also, if you click on the pokemon image in the card, it'll toggle between normal and shiny (color difference. Swaps between images). This is done by passing the update state function from parent to child, again showing some React skills.

## Footer

The footer has icons for both Github and Linked in. They link to my real profiles repectively
